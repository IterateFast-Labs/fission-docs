Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle to provide accurate responses when chunks of text lack sufficient context. To address this, we propose a Contextual Retrieval Framework, where chunk-specific explanatory context is generated and prepended to each chunk before embedding. This contextual augmentation significantly enhances retrieval precision and relevance.

The enhanced retriever incorporates two key components. The first is, Contextual Embedding**.**  Contextual Embedding is generated by appending succinct document-level context to each chunk. Embedding models such as Sentence-BERT or Gemini Text 004 are fine-tuned to encode the augmented information [1]. Contextual BM25 so called, Lexical matching is augmented by indexing the contextualized chunks, improving exact term retrieval [2]. To generate contextual embeddings, we employ a prompt-based approach using large language models (LLMs) like Claude 3. The prompt instructs the model to derive concise, chunk-specific context based on the overall document. This combination creates a hybrid retrieval mechanism that leverages both semantic and lexical capabilities, resolving context-deficiency issues prevalent in traditional RAG systems. The end-to-end workflow follows a structured process. First, a user submits a query. Based on this query, the system performs two parallel retrievals: dense retrieval for semantically similar chunks and BM25 for lexically relevant chunks. The results from both methods are then combined using relevance scoring through ReRanker[4]. Since our team focuses on Asian regional datasets (Korean, Japanese, and Chinese), we utilize the BGE-M3 embedding model, which offers high accuracy while remaining cost-effective. Finally, the generative model produces the response based on the augmented prompt.

### **3.2. Dataset Selection and Preprocessing**

The dataset selection and preprocessing stages are pivotal in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the Contextual Retrieval Framework. The datasets used in this research primarily include human-chat datasets, which provide a rich source of conversational data, mimicking real-world retrieval scenarios. The datasets encompass both private collections and open-sourced repositories to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the retrieval framework.

Preprocessing was carried out in several steps to prepare the datasets for integration into the retrieval system. First, documents were segmented into coherent chunks, each limited to a maximum of 800 tokens to maintain a balance between contextual completeness and computational efficiency. Subsequently, chunk-specific contextual annotations were generated using the latest Claude Sonnet 3.5 language model, which excels in creating succinct and meaningful summaries for embedding purposes. Finally, the annotated and contextualized chunks were embedded and indexed. For vector indexing, we employed Milvus Database, optimized for high-dimensional vectors, using a 1024-dimensional space to capture intricate semantic nuances. For lexical indexing, the BM25 algorithm was implemented to ensure robust and fast retrieval of text-based features.

### **3.3. Implementation Details**

The system was implemented with a combination of advanced tools and methodologies tailored to enhance the retrieval precision and efficiency of the proposed framework. For embedding models, we utilized BGE-M3[5] and BGE-Gemma2[6], both of which are optimized for creating high-dimensional embeddings that capture nuanced semantic relationships. These embeddings were instrumental in the vector indexing process facilitated by Milvus Database, which effectively stored and retrieved the 1024-dimensional vectors. This configuration significantly enhanced the system’s ability to retrieve contextually relevant chunks.[7]

Chunk-specific contextual generation was performed using the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model, a state-of-the-art language model known for its superior summarization and contextualization capabilities.[8] This allowed for the creation of precise and meaningful annotations that improved retrieval performance when combined with the embedding-based search. Additionally, the BM25 algorithm was implemented for lexical indexing using Elasticsearch[9], providing a complementary layer to the vector-based retrieval.

Hyperparameter tuning was conducted rigorously to optimize system performance. The length of the generated context was evaluated across a range of 50 to 150 tokens to determine the optimal size for balancing informativeness and brevity. Retrieval fusion weights were adjusted to find the ideal balance between vector-based embeddings and BM25 lexical results. Embedding dimensions were experimented with at various levels, with 1024 dimensions proving to be the most effective in capturing semantic depth without incurring excessive computational costs.

This comprehensive approach to system implementation and tuning resulted in significant improvements in retrieval precision and overall system effectiveness. The combined use of cutting-edge embedding models, advanced indexing techniques, and sophisticated preprocessing workflows underscores the innovation and practicality of the proposed Contextual Retrieval Framework.[10]
