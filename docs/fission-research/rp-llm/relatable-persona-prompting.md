# Relatable Persona Prompting

### Introduction

In AI-generated storytelling and roleplaying, one key element determines the quality of engaging, believable content: the character. Large language models (LLMs) need a robust information framework to produce nuanced and contextually accurate outputs. A detailed and relatable character sheet provides this framework, offering clear guidelines, personality cues, and behavioral parameters that help generate realistic, human-like content. Without a well-crafted character sheet, interactions and narratives often lack depth, consistency, and relatability. Such shortcomings create immersion-breaking moments that diminish the storytelling experience. In contrast, a thoughtfully designed character sheet anchors LLM outputs in rich character details, creating a seamless and believable narrative flow. Relatable character traits do more than enhance realism—they forge emotional connections between users and AI-generated characters. Through shared values, quirky habits, and compelling backstories, these humanizing details bridge the gap between user expectations and AI responses. This connection proves essential in roleplaying games, narrative design, and virtual companions, where user engagement relies on characters responding authentically and dynamically. Our paper demonstrates a detailed persona prompting sheet that can serve as a powerful tool for developing roleplay services, which are crucial for user interaction and immersive experiences.

## **A. Basic Traits**

### **Purpose:**

Basic traits establish a character's foundational identity and provide critical background information. These are the most fundamental details players or writers need to connect with and develop the character.

1. **Name:**
    - The character's name serves as an identifier and can reflect cultural background, personality, or theme. For example, a name like "Aurora" may evoke an ethereal, celestial theme, while "Kane" might suggest strength or a darker history.
    - **Roleplay Use:** Introduces the character and sets initial impressions during interactions.
2. **Age/Birthdate:**
    - Defines the character’s stage of life and potential maturity level. Birthdate can influence traits such as astrological associations or significant life events.
    - **Roleplay Use:** Helps contextualize behavior, dialogue tone, and relationships with other characters.
3. **Race/Ancestry:**
    - Includes ethnic, national, or fantasy-based ancestry (e.g., human, elf, alien). This reflects cultural influences and biological traits that impact their worldview and abilities.
    - **Roleplay Use:** Adds layers to backstory and informs interactions tied to cultural or racial identity.
