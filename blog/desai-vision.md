## 1. Introduction

### 1-1. What Fission Does

Fission is an AI research and development team that specializes in **model optimization**—making advanced AI models more efficient, scalable, and accessible to a broader range of users. Rather than pouring endless resources into ever-larger models, we focus on streamlining computing requirements and enhancing model performance through smarter, more targeted approaches. Our guiding principle is simple yet profound: **the best AI emerges when technical innovation is combined with high-quality, iterative human feedback.**

To achieve this, we design workflows and tools that invite **user participation** throughout the AI lifecycle. From initial data refinement to ongoing feedback loops, we’ve learned that **human insight**—especially when harnessed at scale—often trumps brute-force computation. By refining AI models through collective user input, we aim to craft systems that are both robust and grounded in real-world needs.

### 1-2. The Core Narrative

As we delved deeper into model optimization, we discovered a critical tipping point: no matter how elegant or efficient our algorithms became, **they still depended on authentic human feedback** to truly excel. While data labeling had been the traditional approach, we realized that **continuous, context-rich evaluation**—from domain experts, enthusiasts, and everyday users—was the key to fine-tuning AI in a more dynamic, impactful way.

However, gathering and managing this feedback via centralized methods proved costly and time-consuming. It was also difficult to maintain transparency and fairness at scale. That challenge led us to explore more decentralized structures—platforms where users could offer feedback and be rewarded in ways that felt natural, equitable, and community-driven.

That’s where **DeSci (Decentralized Science)** entered the conversation. DeSci promised an open, collaborative environment for knowledge-sharing and verification, yet it quickly became clear that **advanced AI** was needed to handle large data streams and real-time inputs. Combining DeSci’s ethos with AI-driven workflows gave rise to **DeSAi**—a synergy merging decentralized collaboration with iterative optimization.

### 1-3. Purpose of This Article

In this article, we share how our journey in AI model optimization naturally led us to embrace **user-driven feedback** at scale, eventually aligning with DeSci principles to form **DeSAi**. One remaining challenge was **how to govern and incentivize these decentralized feedback loops efficiently and fairly**. After evaluating various governance models, we settled on **Futarchy**, which uses prediction markets to guide resource allocation and decision-making.

Ultimately, we want to articulate **why user feedback is not just a ‘nice-to-have,’ but the linchpin** for genuinely optimized AI. We also explain how combining DeSci, AI, and Futarchy can open the door to a vibrant, sustainable, and impactful research ecosystem. Our hope is that this discussion inspires fresh ideas, invites collaboration, and expands what AI can achieve when fueled by collective human insight.

## 2. Why AI Model Optimization Matters

### 2-1. Challenges with Large-Scale AI

Modern AI systems have grown to a scale few anticipated—think of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters or vision transformers processing massive multimodal datasets. While these models exhibit notable capabilities, they also highlight structural issues:

1. **Resource Intensiveness**: Training top-tier LLMs demands enormous GPU/TPU resources, favoring only the most heavily funded institutions.
2. **Data & Quality Bottlenecks**: Gathering (and curating) comprehensive datasets can be logistically daunting, with the risk of poor generalization if hastily compiled.
3. **Diminishing Returns**: Adding parameters yields marginal performance boosts compared to the steep rise in infrastructure, time, and R&D costs.

These factors often concentrate AI advancement in a small number of elite labs, hindering community-driven or smaller-scale innovations. From Fission’s vantage, chasing bigger models forever is no longer tenable.

### 2-2. Fission’s Optimization Insight

Instead of pursuing ever-larger architectures, Fission focuses on **model optimization** that balances performance and accessibility. By using methods such as **knowledge distillation**, **parameter pruning**, and **domain-focused fine-tuning**, we find that smaller, specialized models can match—or surpass—monolithic systems when properly contextualized. This underscores the importance of **relevance**: a well-targeted, efficiently designed model can outperform a generic behemoth.

However, we realized that no matter how well we compress or refine a network, **authentic human feedback** remains critical for genuine success. Consistent, context-rich feedback from real users—be they experts or casual participants—is vital for aligning AI with real-world demands. Model size or clever compression only solves part of the problem; the rest involves harnessing collective human insight to detect errors, refine logic, and adapt to nuanced tasks.

### 2-3. From RLHF to Collective Participation

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** completes this puzzle by embedding user dialogue into training loops. The AI asks clarifying questions, receives critiques, and integrates new suggestions over time. This approach:

- **Enhances Accuracy & Adaptability**: Subtle domain requirements or shifting contexts can be incorporated quickly.
- **Unearths Biases or Gaps**: Human spot checks can reveal flaws not apparent in static benchmarks.
- **Strengthens Ethical Alignment**: Real stakeholders guide moral and situational reasoning, beyond curated datasets.

Scaling RLHF beyond small experiments, however, proved complex—collecting and verifying large amounts of feedback demands robust incentives and transparent coordination. Centralized methods are either too slow or too opaque, but DeSci’s ideal of decentralized collaboration offer an achievable solution. Combining DeSci’s open ethos with bespoke AI pipelines leads us to **DeSAi**, with Futarchy's governance and incentive structure completing Fission's system to ensure unrivaled fairness, alignment, and perpetual evolution.

### 2-4. **Why Privacy-Preserving AI Requires Aggressive Model Optimization**

While standard AI optimization focuses on efficiency and resource usage, **privacy-first contexts**—notably **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**, and **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)**—add further complexity. These technologies promise data confidentiality even during processing, but at the cost of significant overhead. In Fission’s view, **unoptimized AI models are simply infeasible** in these privacy-preserving environments, especially when tackling anything beyond small or highly specialized tasks.

#### 2-4-1. The Bottlenecks in FHE, MPC, and TEE AI

1. **Massive Computational Slowdowns**
   - **FHE’s Slowness**: Homomorphic encryption operations can be orders of magnitude slower than plaintext equivalents, pushing practical AI usage to the limit. Large LLMs, for instance, remain far out of reach for real-time or high-volume scenarios.
   - **MPC’s Overheads**: Distributing computations across multiple parties drastically increases communication and coordination complexity, raising latency. While smaller ML models or stats-based tasks can run in production, deeper neural networks face steep performance drops.
   - **TEE Resource Limits**: Although faster than FHE, secure enclaves provide minimal computing and memory resources, making bigger architectures or real-time inferencing difficult without heavy pruning or quantization.
2. **Memory & Storage Constraints**
   - **Encrypted Data Bloat**: FHE and certain MPC schemes inflate data significantly; naive model designs cause memory usage to spiral.
   - **TEE’s Constrained Enclaves**: The tight memory caps in TEEs hamper large, complex models. Even if an enclave can store the model, throughput and responsiveness often suffer.
3. **Latency & Real-World Responsiveness**
   - **FHE’s Latency**: Encrypted inference can multiply the computation time by hundreds to thousands, ruling out latency-sensitive tasks.
   - **TEE’s Bottleneck**: Although enclaves run at near-native speeds, the overhead from secure context switching and limited resources still hinders real-time AI at scale.

#### 2-4-2. Fission’s Optimization: Opening Doors for Privacy

Through our expertise in **knowledge distillation**, **parameter pruning**, and **domain-focused fine-tuning**, Fission aims to **lower the resource threshold** at which FHE, MPC, and TEE-based AI can operate. While we don’t claim to eliminate all overhead, these optimizations can:

1. **Shrink the Model Complexity**
   Reduced parameter counts or domain-specific architectures make encrypted computations or enclave operations somewhat more feasible.
2. **Enhanced Domain-Specific Focus**
   By tailoring AI to narrower, domain specialized tasks, we avoid the cost of unneeded generalization, a crucial step when every operation is slowed by cryptographic layers or secure enclaves.
3. **Integrate Human Feedback**
   Instead of retraining from scratch, iterative feedback (not limited to RLHF) can refine the model on-the-fly, minimizing repeated heavy computations in encrypted or secure environments.

Importantly, these measures serve as **enablers** rather than a cure-all. Large LLM-style networks remain too big for typical FHE or TEE constraints, and real-time use cases often can’t yet absorb the latency. However, incremental efficiency gains can make more specialized tasks or smaller-scale AI feasible—particularly as the hardware and protocols continue to evolve.

#### 2-4-3. Limited Yet Promising: Making the Most of Privacy-First AI

**Current Reality**: For many large-scale or real-time applications—like GPT-scale language models or complex image processing—FHE, MPC, and TEEs remain prohibitively slow or resource-intensive. Even advanced solutions run 100–1000× slower than plaintext, making it impractical to offer latency-sensitive features.

**Where It Shines**:

- **Smaller Domain Models**: Stripped-down classifiers or specialized NLP tasks can thrive with heavy pruning and domain-specific tuning, turning “private AI” from theory to limited but impactful reality.
- **High-Value, Lower-Volume Use Cases**: Medical diagnostics, private financial analytics, or specialized industrial monitoring can justify performance trade-offs for strong privacy guarantees.
- **Future DePIN-Style Devices**: As specialized hardware (e.g., next-gen GPUs with TEE features) and advanced cryptographic schemes mature, we may see truly private AI extended to decentralized physical infrastructure networks, bridging on-device inference with privacy-by-design.

**Road Ahead**:

- **Cautious Optimism**: The field moves quickly, with new “lightweight” FHE or specialized MPC protocols emerging. Tailoring model design to these constraints—rather than fighting them—could unlock new frontiers in privacy-protected AI.

In short, Fission embraces a realistic stance: FHE, MPC, and TEE solutions for AI remain constrained, but **not impossible**. Through rigorous model optimization and incremental improvements, we believe privacy-preserving AI can support domain-specific tasks today—and possibly break new ground as technology evolves.

## 3. The Turning Point: Human Feedback & Scalability

### 3-1. From Basic Data Labeling to Iterative Feedback

Labeling raw data is fundamental to AI development—transforming unstructured information into training-ready inputs. But while it’s effective initially, such labeling is often treated as a **one-off process**. In practice, AI models benefit from **continuous, contextual refinement**, where human users regularly assess and adjust outputs. At Fission, we discovered:

- **Static vs. Evolving Needs**: Traditional labeling can be rendered obsolete if objectives change. Iterative feedback aligns AI outputs with new goals in near real-time.
- **Surface vs. Subtle Insights**: Simple labels capture obvious distinctions. Ongoing user feedback can reveal deeper nuances (tone, cultural context) that static labels can never convey.
- **Higher-Order Reasoning**: Users can flag logic errors or inconsistencies, driving the model to adapt beyond mere classification.

This nuanced evaluation—often via **RLHF**—treats humans as **active collaborators**, shaping the AI toward more reliable, meaningful performance.

### 3-2. Scaling the Feedback Process

Despite its merits, iterative feedback poses a significant question: **how to gather, validate, and integrate vast user inputs efficiently?** Centralized methods typically require a single entity to manage large contributor pools, fund compensation, and audit authenticity. Such an approach is:

- **Costly**: Maintaining infrastructure and paying contributors can be expensive, skewed by top-down funding.
- **Time-Intensive**: Heavy managerial oversight slows data pipelines, limiting quick iteration.
- **Limited in Diversity**: Centrally curated platforms may inadvertently filter out or ignore essential perspectives.

These issues become glaring in **advanced model** contexts demanding wide-ranging, high-quality feedback. A more distributed model is needed—one that expands participation without exploding overhead.

### 3-3. Towards Automated, Consensus-Driven QA

The typical, centralized approach to handling vast amounts of user feedback—employing dedicated staff or contracting large labeling farms—rapidly becomes both expensive and slow. As participation scales, so do overheads in quality assurance (QA) and authenticity checks. We set out to design a more **automated, consensus-driven process** that could verify and integrate user contributions without a central gatekeeper.

#### Automated QA & Consensus

At Fission, we break down user feedback into modular “micro-tasks,” each requiring incremental checks—ranging from simple binary judgments (e.g., “Is this output correct?”) to more nuanced domain validations (e.g., “Is this financial forecast logically sound?”). Our system then relies on a **distributed consensus layer** where multiple participants, each with a stake or reputation in the ecosystem, reach agreement on the correctness of each micro-task result.

- **Staked Participants**: Individuals or small groups commit tokens or reputation collateral, signaling they will evaluate tasks honestly.
- **Aggregated Scoring**: Feedback from different stakers is combined, filtering out outliers or coordinated attacks. The network then consolidates these partial QA results into a final consensus.
- **Predictive/Automated Checks**: Machine-driven checks (e.g., heuristics or smaller verification models) further scrutinize the aggregated results to catch inconsistencies, spam, or sabotage attempts.

#### Overcoming Bottlenecks

Instead of funneling all user submissions through a single manager or slow editorial pipeline, this approach distributes QA across many semi-autonomous verifiers. Drawing on a synergy of **human oversight** and **lightweight automation**, we can:

- **Reduce Managerial Overhead**: No large staff is required to manually screen and compile thousands of user comments.
- **Empower Diverse Expertise**: Domain specialists can “plug in” to certain micro-tasks, ensuring that high-level inputs—such as legal or financial feedback—are vetted by relevant experts.
- **Achieve Real-Time Scaling**: As the user base grows, so does the pool of staked validators, enabling parallelized, continuous QA without significant slowdowns.

#### Linking Futarchy & Incentives

To further motivate participants, we incorporate **futarchic incentives**: each verifier can stake on the veracity or long-term value of proposed changes, aligning rewards with accurate judgments. By tying gains to outcomes rather than subjective opinions, the system automatically penalizes spam or shallow claims, while surfacing genuinely valuable insights.

1. **Market-Driven Quality**: Overstated or deceptive inputs lose money for those backing them.
2. **Collective Ownership**: Everyone from domain experts to curious enthusiasts can partake, transforming QA into a community-driven project.
3. **Iterative Model Refinement**: As micro-tasks are accepted, the model is updated in near real-time or at scheduled intervals, bridging large-scale feedback with a fluid, decentralized governance.

Ultimately, this consensus-based QA framework supplants the traditional, centralized workflows with a flexible, **community-powered mechanism**. By blending user-friendly micro-tasks, automated checks, and futarchic incentives, Fission ensures continuous, high-quality feedback loops that **scale** with user engagement—without compromising fairness or speed.

## 4. DeSAi: Accelerating DeSci with AI

### 4-1. Why DeSci Alone Isn’t Enough

**DeSci** aims to decentralize authority over scientific discovery, championing open data, inclusive participation, and transparent governance. Yet, in the realm of **large-scale AI**:

- **Data & Real-Time Feedback**: Traditional DeSci structures don’t inherently solve the computational complexities or near-instant feedback loops AI demands.
- **Sustained Incentives**: A volunteer-based approach can falter unless contributors see tangible rewards for their input.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Many blockchain-based or decentralized protocols can be cumbersome, deterring non-technical participants.

### 4-2. Merging AI and DeSci: The Rationale Behind DeSAi

DeSAi emerges from the understanding that DeSci’s collaborative ideals need **advanced AI pipelines** to handle substantial data flows and iterative improvement. By uniting the two, we create an ecosystem where:

- **Data Streams Flow Freely**: Community members supply domain insights and real-time user feedback, powering continuous updates.
- **Models Evolve Contextually**: AI pipelines process these inputs near-instantly, adapting to new discoveries and niche requirements.
- **Transparency Thrives**: On-chain governance logs data, decisions, and model changes for universal verification.

In essence, DeSAi **supercharges** DeSci’s openness, applying it to demanding AI tasks that benefit from both scale and community-based oversight.

### 4-3. Fission’s Approach: Model Optimization + **Human Feedback**

Fission anchors DeSAi on two complementary pillars—one grounded in **efficient architectures** and the other in **continuous, people-powered refinement**:

1. **Model Optimization:** We minimize compute overhead for AI, enabling smaller teams or resource-limited domains to participate in decentralized projects. Rather than infinitely scaling parameter counts, our emphasis is on techniques like parameter pruning, knowledge distillation, and domain-specific fine-tuning. This keeps models agile, interpretable, and better suited for large-scale collaboration where hardware constraints and network demands can be major bottlenecks.
2. **Iterative Human Feedback**: While advanced model designs offer a strong foundation, **human feedback loops**—ranging from casual user hints to expert critiques—ultimately shape an AI’s real-world utility. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is one proven methodology, but our approach isn’t confined to RLHF alone. For instance:

- **Simple Upvote/Downvote Mechanisms**: Community members can quickly signal approval or spot obvious errors.
- **Structured QA**: Domain specialists contribute nuanced clarifications—whether in legal, medical, or financial contexts—enabling targeted improvements.
- **Micro-Task Verification**: Curated, bite-sized evaluations ensure broad participation while maintaining robust quality checks.

As our user base expands, so does the volume and variety of feedback. A globally distributed pool of contributors offers deep domain knowledge, cultural awareness, and creative problem-solving beyond what a purely algorithmic approach could achieve. By uniting efficient architectures with iterative feedback, we maintain a dynamic cycle of improvement—one that’s agile enough to pivot when user needs change, and powerful enough to push AI’s boundaries through genuine community insight.

Hence, Fission’s DeSAi framework transforms an aspirational DeSci concept into an **accelerated discovery engine**, fueled by AI shaped by diverse stakeholders. This synthesis upholds DeSci’s ideals of transparency and inclusivity while adding the computational heft to handle large-scale, continuous research in **AI optimization**.

## 5. Futarchy: Harnessing Hyper-Financialization for Collaborative Governance

### 5-1. Rethinking Hyper-Financialization

Within crypto and Web3, **“hyper-financialization”** often calls to mind unfettered speculation. Yet Fission believes it can be leveraged constructively, turning market enthusiasm into **transparent, outcome-oriented governance**. **Futarchy** serves as the mechanism that aligns economic incentives with real, data-backed progress—rather than hype.

### 5-2. Futarchy Basics: Incentive Alignment via Prediction Markets

Futarchy typically unfolds in two steps:

1. **Define Key Metrics**: The community agrees on a quantifiable goal—model accuracy, real-world usage success, or user satisfaction.
2. **Bet on Proposals**: Participants stake tokens on whether a suggested improvement will enhance that metric. Verified outcomes reward accurate bettors; incorrect guesses lose their stake.

By centering resources on **verifiable performance** instead of promises, Futarchy transforms **financial speculation** into a community filter. Hollow claims quickly lose credibility and capital, while solid ideas gain wide support.

### 5-3. Governing DeSAi with Futarchy

In the DeSAi framework—where user feedback loops (such as RLHF) are crucial—Futarchy ensures:

- **Outcome-Focused Upgrades**: Market-based consensus directs energy toward meaningful improvements.
- **Resilience Against Gaming**: Artificially inflated metrics can be shorted by informed participants, driving a self-correcting process.
- **Sustainable Evolution**: Participants who believe in a model’s long-term potential can reallocate or hold rewards, reinforcing community-led growth.

Thus, Futarchy harnesses **hyper-financialization**—the inflow of capital seeking ROI—and directs it toward genuine, metric-proven gains in AI.

### 5-4. A Positive Spin on Hyper-Financialization

While hyper-financialization often conjures up fears of bubble-like speculation, Futarchy channels it into a system that prioritizes legitimate breakthroughs and penalizes baseless claims:

- **Reality Surfaces Quickly**: If a metric is gamed or inflated, on-chain data eventually contradicts it.
- **Collective Accountability**: Savvy participants profit by uncovering weak proposals, reinforcing honest, data-driven progress.
- **Integrity Matters**: Project owners or researchers proposing improvements must deliver real results if they hope to gain from the predictive markets.

In this way, **hyper-financialization**—managed under a futarchic framework—acts as a filter for authenticity, ensuring speculation aligns with actual model improvements.

### 5-5. Fission’s Perspective: Bridging Markets and AI Research

From Fission’s viewpoint, leaning into hyper-financialization fosters **economic sustainability** for large-scale AI endeavors, guiding capital to promising initiatives. By letting market dynamics and predictive markets surface genuine progress, we unite community-driven research with iterative AI optimization:

- **Transparency at Scale**: On-chain governance logs each prediction, outcome, and model update.
- **Accelerated Innovation**: Sound proposals gain backing, fueling expansions in data coverage and RLHF enhancements.
- **Collective Ownership**: Rather than a few influential backers dictating direction, anyone with insight can guide AI’s path.

Put simply, Futarchy transforms hyper-financialization into a supportive engine—turning pure speculation into communal intelligence that advances DeSAi’s broader goals.
